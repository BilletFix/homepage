      'BilletFix offers a ticketing system to students who volunteer a lot of time and energy into organising events for their fellow students.

The guests pay the lowest service fee possible of 3 kr per paid ticket (only a bottle deposit) - AND your guests can pay with MobilePay! Too good to be true, right? Well, to keep the servers running and fuel our developers with energy drinks we find advertisers to support the project.",
